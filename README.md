# covid-data

COVID-data is a series of Jupyter Notebooks to parse COVID data coming from [
Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org). Data displayed here is mostly about France, but this is made to be easily adapatable to any other countries.

You can find here :
* New confirmed cases of COVID-19 (7-day smoothed) per 1,000,000 people by country: [COVID Cases](https://github.com/simonmoreau/covid-data/blob/main/COVID%20Cases.ipynb)
* The total deaths attributed to COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people: [COVID Death](https://github.com/simonmoreau/covid-data/blob/main/COVID%20Death.ipynb)
* The total number of COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people in the total population by country: [COVID Vaccine](https://github.com/simonmoreau/covid-data/blob/main/COVID%20Vaccine.ipynb)
* The new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the new deaths attributed to COVID-19 (7-day smoothed) per 1,000,000 people, along the lockdowns periods: [COVID Lockdown Effect](https://github.com/simonmoreau/covid-data/blob/main/COVID%20Lockdown%20Effect.ipynb)
